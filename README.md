# TheWatcher :eyes:

## Introduction
There is insufficient focus on proper auditing and documentation when conducting digital forensics investigation.

There is an oversaturated market for tools to conduct the analysis of evidence, and few existing solutions exist that focus on the documentation and auditing of the investigation process. This can result in possible tampering or general mishandling of the exhibits during an investigation, which discredits the investigator and the gathered evidence. As a solution, our team has come up with “The Watcher”. A system that tracks events and documents every step of the investigation process.
